# auxiliary functions to estimate DR
# from the SM of Jetz etal. 2012:
#       The ES measure for a focal tip on a rooted bifurcating tree is the sum of the edge lengths from the species i
# to the root, with each consecutive edge discounted by a factor of 1/2:
#   ESi = sum (from j = 1 to Ni) [ lj * ( 1/2^(j-1) ) ]ïƒ¥ (Supplementary equation 1)
# Ni is the number of edges on the path from species i and the root, and lj is the length of the edge j, with j=1
# being the pendant edge leading to the species and j=Ni being the edge nearest the root on that path. For a more
# general equation for non-bifurcating trees, see Redding et al. (2008).
#        The inverse of this measure can be seen as a measure of the splitting rate of the path to a tip: species in 
# rapidly-diversifying clades will have short edge lengths shared among many species and low ES values, while isolated 
# species on a tree have no evidence of recent diversification and large ES values. We term the 1/ES metric for a
# species its species-level lineage diversification rate, or DR.
