	- (Hoppefully) Finishing my analysis for the ecoevo retreat! My initial idea was to estimate patterns of subspeciation (ie, time-to-speciation and rate of subspecies formation) and see whether they explain the Latitudinal Diversity Gradient. I did a pilot on that several months ago. The phylogeny is too big and there is excessive amount of other types of variation (~7,000 tips!). Also, in other to try and get the possible effect of the trait (latitudinal distribution) on the rates, I removed form the phylogeny thousands of tips at a time. I had 5 phylogenies for each Jetz tree: Tropical and Mixed, Tropical, Mixed,  Temperate, Temperate and Mixed. As we know, removing tips from a phylogeny creates a bias in the rate estimates. So I wanted to have a monophyletic clade, where all species shared the same trait.
	
	- Created several functions ("analysis/R/auxiliary_functions.R") to help me get those "monophyletic" subclades and prepare them for the analysis ("analysis/R/Jetz_Botero_subclade_data.R"). The distribution of latitude is too unequal: almost all of the species are Tropical or Mixed (ie, their distributional range crosses the tropical lines). I could basically get 1 Temperate subclade, which is not nearly enough to have a reliable estimate of the rates.
	
	- Moved on to another analysis, now focusing on the "harshness". Botero et al. (2014) had several environmental estimates for the geographical regions and reduced the dimensionality using PCoA. The first PCA is what they called "harshness" because it covaries with several environmental variables of an "extreme" environment, like maximum and minimum temperature. Botero et al. found that "harshness" is correlated with latitude (far from perfectly, though) and it also explain the subspecies richness. So they propose the LDG cannot be explained by the subspeciation pattern. On the contrary, the pattern indicates that Temperate regions would form more species and at some point the LDG may disappear. There are at least 2 big assumptions here: that more subspecies corresponds to more (or more rapidly; is it different?) species formation; that the process is mainly controlled by speciation rates and extinction plays a minor role.
	
	- Botero et al.'s results raises the question of how these subspecies came about. I believe I can answer that with my Bayesian PBD. First, I converted the continuous "harshness" measure into a categorical variable: Stable, Regular, Variable. (There is also a 5-category classification, but I will stick to the 3 for now.) I repeated the same process as to the latitude. I searched for all "monophyletic" subclades with at least 30 tips. However, it is too variable and there is hardly any clade (and most are Regular!). So I allowed for 30% of mixture in a subclade; ie, at least 70% of the tips in a given subclade share the same trait. Them I run 2 chains of the "pbd_Bayes" in the cluster ("harsh"; Crunch09) for each subclade during 5e+06 steps. But these subclades have some degree of mixture, so I dropped the "mixed" tips from each subclade and run a separate analysis ("harshClean"; Crunch10). Both the analysis ignore subclades that have "Regular" as the main trait.
